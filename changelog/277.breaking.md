We removed the `sec_cats` entry from the metadata in a dataset's `attrs` in the native format
as well as the interchange format. It did not add much value, but maintaining it was work, so on balance
we decided to remove it.
When reading datasets from disk (from the interchange format or netcdf files), `sec_cats` will be ignored
so that datasets written with earlier versions of primap2 can still be read and produce valid in-memory
datasets.
